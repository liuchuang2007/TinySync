All things show up just because it be needed. There has been many synchronization tools. such as rsync and sersync2, even NFS also can
be used. Here I didn't want to make a comparison with those tools. They are really great but not just size for me. My goal is just simple,
easy and effective. That's enough. However it's just the early edition, more update will comes.

Server start up cmd example:
>java -jar syncserver.jar /home/george/srcDir

Client start up cmd example:
>java -jar sync.jar /home/george/distDir 127.0.0.1 9900
